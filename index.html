										<h3>Open To Work!</h3>
										<p>
											<b>I am on the industry job market this fall (2025)</b>.  If you could use a research scientist and/or engineer (yes, I can do both!) with expertise in signal processing (especially audio), geometry processing (especially 3D), algorithm design, and/or machine learning, drop me a line and we can chat.  <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJv3UhDboGs">Click here</a> to see a recent example of how I work/think.
										</p>

										<h3>Overview</h3>
										<p>
											I am a long time coder who's an artist/mathematician at heart, and I believe in cultivating kindness and human flourishing.  Education, mentoring, and <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/ctralie">sharing ideas widely and authentically</a> are central to my mission.
										</p>

										<p>
											I do <a href = "https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=Ka-p3u0AAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate">research</a> in audio processing and geometry processing, mostly focused on music information retrieval, but also with some applications to medical data analysis.  In all of my work, I have a strong focus on algorithm visualizations and <a href = "https://github.com/ctralie">open source software</a> development.
										</p>

										<p>
											I am a teacher at heart, and I was a professor for 6 years, eventually earning tenure.  During that time, my teaching specialties were in CS theory (<a href = "https://ursinus-cs271-f2023.github.io/CoursePage/index.html">data structures</a>, <a href = "https://ursinus-cs373-f2023.github.io/CoursePage/">theory of computation</a>) and CS applications (<a href = "https://ursinus-cs476-f2022.github.io/CoursePage/">computer graphics</a>, <a href = "https://ursinus-cs372-s2023.github.io/CoursePage/index.html">digital music processing</a>, and <a href = "https://ursinus-cs477-f2023.github.io/CoursePage/">artificial intelligence</a>).  Now I make videos on <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/ctralie">YouTube</a> for even wider audiences.
										</p>
										

										<p>
											My partner <a href = "https://www.celialitovsky.com/">Celia Litovsky</a> teaches in <a href = "https://www.goucher.edu/learn/goucher-prison-education-partnership/">prisons</a> (and in <a href = "https://www.brynmawr.edu/inside/people/celia-litovsky">more typical environments</a>) and does research in neuroscience and educational science, particularly focused on reading and literacy, but also with a long term interest in alzheimer's research.  My brother <a href = "https://www.jamestralie.com/">James Tralie</a> makes videos for NASA as well as <a href = "https://www.instagram.com/james_films/">various 3D art projects</a> on the side (including my favorite application ever: <a href = "https://luttrell.bandcamp.com/album/music-for-my-memories">Luttrell's album art</a>).

                                        <h3>Academic Bio Sketch</h3>
										<p>
											For posterity, below is an academic bio sketch of my 18 years in academia.  I'm also keeping my academic CV at <a href = "ctralie_cv.pdf">this link</a>, though it's frozen in time in summer 2024 as I went up for tenure.
										</p>

										<p>I received a B.S.E. in <a href = "http://www.ee.princeton.edu/">Electrical Engineering</a> with a <a href = "http://www.cs.princeton.edu/">Computer Science</a> minor at <a href = "http://www.princeton.edu">Princeton University</a> in 2011, an M.S. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from <a href = "http://www.duke.edu">Duke University</a> in 2013, and a Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from from <a href = "http://www.duke.edu">Duke University</a> in 2017.  As a Ph.D. student, I was advised jointly by <a href = "http://sapirolab.pratt.duke.edu/">Guillermo Sapiro</a> and <a href = "https://scholars.duke.edu/person/john.harer">John Harer</a>, and I was funded by an <a href = "http://nsfgrfp.org/">NSF Graduate Fellowship</a>.  I was also member of the <a href = "https://gradschool.duke.edu/professional-development/programs/certificate-college-teaching">College Certificate in Teaching (CCT)</a> program at Duke.  
										</p>

										<p>
										After doing a postdoc in the <a href = "https://math.duke.edu/">Math Department</a> at Duke followed by another postdoc in the <a href = "https://engineering.jhu.edu/chembe/">Chemical And Biomedical Engineering Department</a> at Johns Hopkins, I began a tenure track faculty position in the <a href = "https://www.ursinus.edu/academics/mathematics-computer-science-and-statistics/">Department of Mathematics And Computer Science</a> at Ursinus College in the fall of 2019.  I received tenure in 2025, and I also received the <a href = "https://www.ursinus.edu/offices/academic-affairs/faculty-achievement/faculty-commencement-awards/">Laughlin Teaching Award</a> that year in recognition of outstanding teaching, as nominated by students and ultimately selected by the college president to be presented at commencement with the class of 2025.  Satisfied with my academic achievements at that point, I decided to <a href = "https://ctralie.substack.com/p/my-transition-out-of-academia">step away from my role as a professor</a> to pursue opportunities in industry, though I remain as a "<a href = "https://www.ursinus.edu/live/profiles/4502-christopher-tralie">research fellow</a>," supervising undergraduate research projects as part of my <a href = "Research/GASPGroup">Audiovisual Signal Processing (GASP) Research Group</a>.  </p>

                                        
                                        <h3>Other</h3>
                                        <p>
                                           I'd like to highlight <a href = "https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~kuipers/opinions/no-military-funding.html">an essay by Benjamin Kuipers</a> on the proliferation of military funding in academia, which remains a serious problem.  Related to this, I also recently wrote <a href = "https://ctralie.substack.com/p/the-bang-for-the-buck-of-nsf">an essay</a> about how the National Science Foundation (NSF) changed my life, and why we shouldn't be cutting funding to such a crucial agency.
