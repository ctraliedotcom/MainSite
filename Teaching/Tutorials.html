										<h1>Tutorials</h1>
									</header>


									<p>
									When I was a student (both undergrad/grad), I wrote a lot of educational web tutorials on a diverse array of topics as a hobby.  Some of these articles began in classes I took when I was an undergraduate at Princeton University, and some of them were written for fun on my own time.  Many of them remain popular to this day, so I am archiving them here.  All math is displayed in LaTeX using <a href = "http://www.math.union.edu/~dpvc/jsMath/authors/welcome.html">the jsMath plugin</a>.  Code is displayed using <a href = "http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/">Alex Gorbatchev's SyntaxHighlighter</a>.  And comments are served by <a href = "http://disqus.com/">DISQUS</a>.

									Last Updated 10/6/2009</td>
									<td><img src = "EdgeCornerBlob/pic.png"></td><td>This tutorial explains the math behind Canny Edge detection, corner detection, and basic blob detection: three extremely important algorithms at the heart of computer vision.<!--<BR><BR>

									Last Updated 9/18/2011</td>
									<td><img src = "SeamCarving/pic.jpg"></td><td>This tutorial explains a relatively simple technique for "content-aware image resizing."  The algorithm attempts to find "less important" regions of an image and delete them first, so that an image doesn't get uniformly blurred before getting resized.  As such, it does a much better job preserving important details after resizing.  This technique can also be used to remove unwanted objects from an image.<!--<BR><BR>

									Last Updated 10/12/2010</td>
									<td><img src = "ImageAnalogies/pic.png"></td><td>I explain an amazing technique that came out of the NYU graphics group that does the following: Given two images A and A' with some relationship between them, start with an image B and synthesize an image B' from scratch that has the same relationship.  For instance, if A' is a blurred version of A, B' should be a blurred version of B.  There possibilities are endless. (This was the first assignment for a graduate computer graphics class I took as a Princeton senior)<!--<BR><BR>

									Last Updated 3/25/2012</td>
									<td><img src = "PoissonImageEditing/pic.png"></td><td>This is a tutorial I wrote about a technique to seamlessly blend images together fully automatically.  The heart of the algorithm rests on a very simple idea that I've attempted to explain as clearly as I can for an audience that may be a bit rusty on math.  Best of all, I made an interactive Java applet that lets people try the technique out.  My hope is that this program will allow just about anyone to do wacky things with images on their own desktop, even if they aren't interested in understanding exactly how it works.<BR><BR><a href = "PoissonImageEditing/InteractivePoisson.html">Try It Out Yourself!</a><BR><BR>

									Last Updated 1/11/2011</td>
									<td><img src = "FGSurvSeg/pic.jpg"></td><td>This tutorial presents two different algorithms to automatically segment foreground and background objects in video.  One technique uses a mixture of Gaussians, while the other technique uses information in the frequency domain.  (This was my final project for a senior year image processing class at Princeton)<BR><BR>

									<tr><td><h2><a href = "ShapeMatching">3D Shape Matching</a></h2><BR>
									Last Updated 11/21/2010</td>
									<td><img src = "ShapeMatching/pic.png"></td><td>Given a 3D shape, this tutorial explains how to find the "most similar" shape in a database of pre-defined shapes.  It uses machine learning techniques based off of "shape descriptors," which try to capture some of the geometry of a shape in a vector.  It also introduces "precision-recall" graphs, a useful and more general technique for analyzing how well machine learning algorithms work.  This tutorial is closely related to my <a href = "../../PrincetonUGRAD/Projects/IWS2010/ctralie_finalIWreport.pdf">senior thesis</a> at Princeton, which was to analyze a novel 3D shape descriptor for point clouds in cities.</td></tr>

									Last Updated 3/7/2009</td>
									<td><img src = "BasicMesh/pic.png"></td><td>This was an assignment in an intro to computer graphics class I took when I was a sophomore in college.  It goes over basic operations that can be performed on 3D triangular meshes.</td></tr>!-->

									<tr><td><h2><a href = "LapMesh">Laplacian Mesh Editing</a></h2><BR>
									Last Updated 10/30/2010</td>
									<td><img src = "LapMesh/pic.png"></td><td>This tutorial talks about how to move one vertex on a 3D mesh away from its original position and to have the mesh bend and stretch gracefully to accomadate this change.  (This was the second assignment for a graduate computer graphics class I took as a Princeton senior)</td></tr>

									<tr><td><h2><a href = "MeshSeg">Mesh Segmentation Using KMeans Clustering</a></h2><BR>
									Last Updated 11/29/2010</td>
									<td><img src = "MeshSeg/pic.png"></td><td>I present a simple technique used to automatically divide 3D surfaces up into smaller parts that have semantic meaning.  (This was the third assignment for a graduate computer graphics class I took as a Princeton senior)</td></tr>

									<td>A light introduction to Taylor Series.  I derive it from a differential and integral point of view, I show how to estimate the remainder term, and I give lots of examples, including how to approximate the square root of two and why small angle approximation works.

My job was to summarize set cover, hitting set, and independent set in a geometric context.
