Parallelizable Dynamic Time Warping with Linear Memory
======================================================

This repository contains an implementation of the linear memory,
parallelizable algorithm for Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) described in
[1], which we refer to as \``linmdtw’’ for short. This algorithm can be
used to align multivarite time series that are re-parameterized version
of each other, such as audio of different orchestral performances.

This repository also contains efficient cython implementations of
FastDTW [2] and Memory-Restricted Multiscale DTW (MrMsDtw). Please refer
to the background examples for usage.

For simplicity of implementation, we have restricted our focus to
multivariate time series in Euclidean spaces, but pull requests are
welcome!

Installation
------------

To get started, simply type

.. code:: bash

   pip install linmdtw

Alternatively, you can checkout this repository and run 


.. code:: bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt 
    python setup.py install

Audio Utilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, it only install requirements needed to align general
Euclidean time series. To use the audio features and audio stretching
utilities, you must also install the audio requirements 

.. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/ctralie/linmdtw.git 
    cd linmdtw 
    pip install -r requirements.txt 
    python setup.py install

GPU Acceleration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This library falls back to a CPU implementation when a GPU is not
available, but it is not recommended. If you have a CUDA-capable GPU on
your computer, you should install an appropriate version of pycuda by
running

.. code:: bash

   pip install -r requirements_gpu.txt
